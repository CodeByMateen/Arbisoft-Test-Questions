# Contribution Guidelines

To keep the repository organized and easy to navigate, please follow these guidelines when contributing:

1. Directory Structure:
Each company should have its own directory. The directory should be named as the company name. If a directory for a company doesn't exist, please create one.

Example:


```python
/Arbisoft
/Devsinc
/Educative
.
.

```

Inside each company directory, there should be a README file and subdirectories for job role or interview type (HR interview, technical interview or any specific directory specific to the company)

Example:

```python
/Arbisoft
   README.md    #this readme will include hiring process 
   /Questions 
   /Internship
   .
   .
/Educative
   README.md
   /Questions
   /Internship
   .
   .
.
.
```

2. README File for Companies:
The README file in the company directory should outline the hiring process of that particular company. It can include things like:

* Online application process
* Number of interview rounds
* Types of interviews (phone screening, technical, behavioral, onsite, etc.)
* Any specific tips or points to note about this company's hiring process
This will give the reader a clear understanding of what to expect when applying to that company.

3. Interview Questions Directories:
In the subdirectories for each job role or interview type, contributors should add text files (.txt or .md) containing the interview questions they faced, or know of. Each question should be in a separate file with an appropriate file name. If possible, also include answers or recommended strategies for answering these questions.

Example:

```python
/Arbisoft
   README.md
   /Questions
      README.md  # you can add questiosn to the pool of questions
      candidate1.md # or make your seperate questions list
      candidate2.md
      .
      .
      .
```
